# NYC_Traffic_Analysis
## This project is aimed at analyzing the traffic condition over the past ten years from 2012 - 2022.
## The data source comes from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95. Since the original dataset is too large to upload, so you have to download the dataset from the website and then run the 'Data_Processing_New.ipynb' to clean the original dataset, then run the 'Final_project_all_code.ipynb' to get the analysis result.
